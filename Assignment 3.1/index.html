        <bold>Mathematics</bold> -Probably the only field of science for which
        you can find areas that cannot be applied in everyday life is mathematics,
        which is beautiful in itself. On the other hand, without its achievements,
        there would be no development of technical thought, natural and economic sciences,
        philosophy or even art. Disliked by some for being difficult, adored by others
        for being consistent, not subject to discussion and manipulation. Mathematics
        is the art of generalization, it is inferring, applying thoughts and creating
        abstract worlds somewhere in human minds, making us unique creatures - rational beings.
